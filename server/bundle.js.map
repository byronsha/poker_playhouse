To fix this you can try two solutions. First, you can exclude files or directories (for example, /node_modules/) using 'exclude' option in loader configuration. Second, if you are using Babel, you can enable loose mode for `es6.modules` using the 'loose' option. See: http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-es2015-modules-commonjs/#options-loose and http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  return foundReactClasses;\n}\n\nmodule.exports = makeExportsHot;\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/react-hot-loader/makeExportsHot.js\n// module id = 8\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
